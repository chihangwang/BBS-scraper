This is a crawler for Bulletin Board System (BBS), one of the most popular Social Networks among college students in Taiwan.
I build this crawler to collect information from every piece of article in BBS-Gossiping section to develop a user-tracking 
application, allowing all users in BBS to track down the posts on their article.

Dependency:
You need node.js, cheerio.js and request.js to run this script. 

Usage:
Please specify the range you want to crawl by setting pttTraversal(start, end) function.
Then simply type "node scrape.js" in cmd and there you go!
